					<font size="+0.1%">There are several established algorithms specializing in noise reduction of audio and
					speech. We will look at some that are based on the
					Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). This technique slices the audio in short time frames
					to be able to analyze the local complex frequency spectrum. The noise reduction procedure
					compare the audio spectrum with its estimated noise spectrum to calculate an attenuation
					at each frequency. The attenuated signal is transformed back into time domain. Some of
					the algorithms are based on the Wiener filter or AR-modeling. The program will include
					a user interface with selectable algorithms and parameters. In old recordings a certain
					level of noise may be wanted to preserve authenticity. Thus a noise floor generator will be
					implemented.</font>

						<p>The first algorithms for noise reduction within a signal, were developed in the late 70’s and early 80’s to digitally enhance
						speech perception. They are based around the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). This
						technique analyzes the audio by extracting short time frames and transforming them into
						the frequency domain. Throughout the 90's, many papers have been released focusing on
						audio restoration. There are primarily two popular papers presenting two strikingly different algorithms.
						</p>
						<p>The First is a Wiener filter based on the approach articulated in Godsill and Rayner's book, 'Digital Audio Restoration - A Statistical Model'. The Second is a more complex algorithm
						presented in the article 'Elimination of the Musical Noise Phenomenon with the Ephraim
						and Malah Suppressor' by Oliver Cappé. There exist other algorithms not based on
						STFT, but they are not discussed in as detail. We tried to analyze the same thing using Wavelet
						Transform, by implementing the Haar wavelet, doing the Soft & Hard Thresholding across the median value obtained and reconstructing the output denoised signal using inverse wavelet transform.</p>

						Extract	noiseprint from loaded Wav File then compute its STFT and estimate Noise spectrum. 
						Meanwhile compute STFT of Original signal and use a Suppression rule on estimated Noise spectrum.
						Then after compute Inverse STFT after suppressing noise.
						Pass this through Low pass filter.
						Since some of the original piece is lost in residue add required Noise Floor.
